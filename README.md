Snake Game AI: Pathfinding Algorithms

This project implements AI strategies to guide a snake in a classic Snake game using pathfinding algorithms. Developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course, it explores algorithmic efficiency and decision-making under constraints.

Features

Greedy AI: Selects the shortest visible path to food.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Computes the optimal path using weighted graphs.
A Algorithm*: Combines graph traversal with heuristic-based optimization for efficient pathfinding.
Performance Analysis: Compares scores and efficiency across different strategies, with and without obstacles.

Technologies

Python: Core implementation and algorithm development.
NetworkX: Used for graph-based Dijkstra visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For testing, analysis, and visualization.

How to Run

Clone the repository.
Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook for simulations.
Test AI strategies under varying obstacle configurations and analyze results.
